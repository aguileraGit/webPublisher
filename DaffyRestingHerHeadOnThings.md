# One lazy dog

### A poem [by AI]
"In the quiet dawn, where sunlight plays,
Lies Daffy, our lazy dog, in soft morning rays.
Her head rests gently on a pillow so kind,
Where she starts her day, contented and blind. 

To a lamp she moves, with a yawn quite grand,
"Ouch!" she mutters, for it's not so grand.
A metal embrace, cold and unkind,
She lifts her head, leaving the lamp behind. 

Next, she seeks warmth near the teapot's song,
On the kitchen counter where morning is long.
Her golden retriever curls snugly tight,
In the warmth of the day, she feels so right. 

Then to a book she ventures with a wagging tail,
Seeking comfort on its leather pale.
A shrug from Daffy as she finds it stiff,
She moves on, her heart still kind andiff. 

Now she espies a clock that ticks away,
Its face just right for a sunny lay.
With a stretch and a sigh, she claims her spot,
Where time stands still in the ticking lot. 

Finally, she curls in a cozy nook of boots,
Her golden fur blending with the wooden roots.
A contented snore escapes her lips,
As she rests where comfort once again trips. 

So Daffy's day is filled with gentle ease,
Exploring objects, finding comfort in peace.
Though lazy she may be, her charm never wanes,
In every spot, her presence remains."
